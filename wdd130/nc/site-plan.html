      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This page is a general summary of the life of the average citizen in Night City. Night City, depending on who is answering the question, can be both a great and terrible place to live. From a Corpo or a blissfully ignorant gonk's perspective, it is an incredible place to live. From literally anyone else's perspective, it is a horrible place to live. The media lies and the citizens live in happiness, so huzzah to the joys of mind-numbing consumerism!

      <h3>Pros</h3>
      <p>
        This page is a comprehensive breakdown of reasons why to live in Night City. At least you have the Second Amendment! But no seriously, carry always or you'll end up dead in an alley. It is also a beautiful industrial complex city with a very active night life. We're talking pachinko, dancing, casinos, other not-so-savory activities. You choose! There are also a fair number of incredible tourist attractions, like the abandomed Grand Imperial Mall in Pacifica, which has been overrun by the Voodoo Boys, a gang of anti-corpos that built their own ecosystem right within the slums bordering the rest of Night City. There's also Arasaka Tower, which was bombed by terrorist threat Johnny Silverhand back in 2023.

      </ul>
      <h3>Cons</h3>
      <p>
        This page is a comperehensive breakdown of reasons why <i>not</i> to live in Night City. Like I said before, you'll probably end up dead in an alley if you're not carrying. Also, corporations pretty much run the entire city. Good luck ever finding good enough employment outside of selling your soul to companies that control legislation and hate you. Additionally, several districts inside the city are run by gangs full of chromed up cyberpsychos that will kill you just for looking at them weird. Also, steer clear of Dogtown, because while Night City is its own goverment seperate from the New United States of America, Dogtown is also its own goverment seperate from Night City. If you think Night City is bad, think Mad Max on steroids.
